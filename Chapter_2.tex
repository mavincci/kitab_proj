\section{Non-Functional Requirement}

Below are the non-functional attributes that kitab must satisfy to increase the quality.

	\subsubsection{Performance}
	\begin{itemize}

		\item New event and notification reaches users in near realtime.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Accessibility}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Kitab's website is accessible in any internet connected device.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Security}

		\item The web-client is also accessible 24/7 for devices with internet connection.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Feasibility Study}
we have conducted a feasibility study to assess the viability of our project. We have investigated to identify whether conditions are probable for the system to work effectively. The information gathered helps us in determining the extent to which the project can perform successfully.

\bigskip

The study assesses the following feasibility studies listed below on Kitab.

	\subsection{Technical feasibility}
The system we are going to develop (Kitab) includes web-based system and an app for mobile devices. Currently there are many technologies out there to implement this system.
These are

	\begin{description}
	\item[Flutter] framework which is used to develop cross platform apps. Including mobile( android, ios and fucsia), web and desktop applications.
	\item[Gin] an http web-framework for golang which makes our task easy to develop the backend of our web based system. We use it with gorilla which is also fantastic to do the middle-ware of the system.
	\item[React js] JavaScript frontend framework which makes it easy to develop reactive front-end applications.
	\end{description}

All of them are open source technologies. Related to hardware requirement these components are easy and suitable for the servers to deploy. Having these technologies and resources makes our project technically feasible.

	\subsection{Operational feasibility}
We have investigated the operational feasibility of our project and arrived at the conclusion that the system will satisfy the users’ requirements as well as the publishers’ business requirements since it supports the functions they are conducting currently and they are expecting from the system.

	\subsection{Economic feasibility}
The system we are going to develop will reduces the cost needed for printing books since books are distributed digitally through the platform. Additionally, it will increase the number of readers which in turn will increase the profit of the publishers. Since the benefit of the system will outweigh the development cost the system is economically feasible.

	\subsection{Schedule feasibility}
We have properly arranged schedule which will lead us in the right way. This makes our project schedule feasible.

	\subsection{Behavioral feasibility}
Most of us are familiar with mobile devices and can browse the internet. The system we are developing will have easy and intuitive interface which doesn't require additional knowledge about navigating the application for any ordinary mobile device user.
