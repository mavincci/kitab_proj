\chapter{System Analysis and Modelling}
\section{Overview}
In this chapter, we are going to use different modelling and diagramming techniques to better understand and describe
the gathered requirements for kitab. For the same purpose, we considered the modelling techniques listed below.

	\begin{description}
		\item[Scenario based modelling] - with UML is the technique begins with the creation of different scenarios in order to understand the problem to be solved. Done by using use-case diagram and activity diagram.
		\item[Behavioural/Dynamic modelling] - by using Sequence diagram and state diagram.
		\item[Class-based modelling] - by using class diagram.
	\end{description}

\section{Scenario Based Modelling}

In this section we will determine and model specific procedures of the system, who take part in these procedures and steps to achieve goals of each procedure.

	\begin{description}
		\item[Admin] - by using use-case diagram and activity diagram.
		\item[Publisher] - by using use-case diagram and activity diagram.
		\item[Reader] - by using Sequence diagram and state diagram.
		\item[Author] - by using Sequence diagram and state diagram.

\section{Behavioural/Dynamic Modelling}

Behavioural/Dynamic modelling is a system of modeling the dynamic behavior of a system as it is executing. It shows what happens or what is supposed to happen when a system responds to a stimulus from its environment.

These stimuli may be either data or events:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Data becomes available that has to be processed by the system. The availability of the data triggers the processing.
		\item An event happens that triggers system processing. Events may have associated data, although this is not always the case.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Class-Based Modeling}

Structural models of software display the organization of a system in terms of the components that make up that system and their relationships.

\textbf{Class-diagrams} for modeling the static structure of the object classes in a software system are used when developing an object-oriented system model to show the classes in a system and the associations between these classes.
