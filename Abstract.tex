\emph{In Ethiopia books are being distributed manually.There is no any digital system dedicated for distributing and reading books which makes it difficult for readers to access books.Readers have to go to bookstores and search books manually.Even they may not get what they want.In this manual process the interaction between readers and authors is very low which is difficult to authors to understand readers' feedback about their books. Additionally in this manual process the publishers have to pay a lot to publish and distribute their books. Our project "KITAB-An Ethiopian Book Store" will tries to address these problems. In this project we are developing a system which helps readers to access books from wherever they are by using their mobile phone.}
